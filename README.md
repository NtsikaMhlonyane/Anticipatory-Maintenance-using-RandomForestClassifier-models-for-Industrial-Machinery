# Anticipatory-Maintenance-using-RandomForestClassifier-models-for-Industrial-Machinery
This project uses machine learning to predict machine failures in an industrial setting, aiding in maintenance planning. Exploratory data analysis and RandomForestClassifier models contribute to operational efficiency and downtime reduction.

## Overview
This project aims to predict machine failures using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training with RandomForestClassifier, time series analysis with LSTM, and model evaluation.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Exploration (EDA)
- Explored the dataset, revealing key statistical insights.
- Analyzed categorical variables to understand their distributions.

### 2. Model Training with RandomForestClassifier
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Trained a RandomForestClassifier model, achieving a precision score of 0.95.

### 3. Time Series Analysis with LSTM
- Implemented an LSTM model for time series analysis.
- Achieved an accuracy of 92% on the test set.

### 4. Results Summary
- RandomForestClassifier: Precision - 95%
- LSTM: Accuracy - 92%

### 5. Conclusion
- Identified significant predictors of machine failures.
- LSTM model demonstrated strong performance on time series data.
